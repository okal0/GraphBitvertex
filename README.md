# Graph algorithms using Bitvertex representation
- This repository includes 3 elementary graph algorithms utilizing binary operations with Bitvertex rep.
- Algorithms are : BFS, DFS and Topological Sort
- Running main.c generates 3 txt files which includes execution times of algorithms
- Then running helper.py script generates 3 plots to visualize comparing bitvertex and standard algorithms
- Standard BFS, DFS, Topological Sort -> Uses a standard algorithm based on 2D adjacency list
- Bitvertex BFS, DFS, Topological Sort > Utilizes Bitvertex representation which is closer to CPU architechture, adjacency information is stored inside integer bits.
